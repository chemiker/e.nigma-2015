# e.nigma 2015

**e.nigma 2015** is a light-weight, modern, simple WordPress theme that was developed for users that use WordPress [post-types](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types). It is thought to be used with [WordPress posts formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats).

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Active the theme in your WordPress installation
3. Add the *e.nigma Infotext* widget to the *Information* widget area to add an infotext to your footer

## Usage
The usage of the theme is self-explaining. Customization of the footer can be done in the Customizer (Note: the About field supports shortcodes for e.g. adding social-media buttons).

If using the "image" post-type it is recommended to set the image you want to show as a featured image. This will set the image as the background of the post. Your image can use the complete width of the users screen.

## Plugin support

**e.nigma 2015** brings the build in support (mostly CSS classes) for a range of WordPress plugins:

* [CF Post Formats](https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-post-formats) *(recommended)*
* [e.nigma buttons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enigma-buttons/) *(recommended)*
